# UX

#### User Stories

- As an external user I want the following:

    - To be able to navigate the website easily to find the graphic designs Im interest in.

    - To be able to make searches that will generally search the products Im looking for.

    - To be able to then purchase a design once I find the one Im looking for.

    - To be able to see previous orders that I made as a user

- As an Internal user I want the following:

    - To have a visually apealling website that draws users in once they land on the homepage.

    - To have a website that is easy to navigate.

    - To have a website that always users to easily place an order which I can recieve payments from.

    - To be able to see the orders made by external users ordering from the website.


#### Wireframes

The five planes of UX were kept in mind from the beginning of the design to the end. The wireframes for this project were a very basic starting place for me to lay the foundation of the website. Many other screens were quickly added such as login/sign-up/confirm email/ but these views come with the Django framework. Some other screens that did not come with the framework and that were not create at the beginning in the wireframes were the checkout view and custom 404 page.

#### Design
The overall theme of the website is an luminous background that was chosen to give a sense of awe to an external user for when they come to land on the website.
